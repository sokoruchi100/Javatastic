                        Hi! Welcome to Javatastic's first lesson page: Unit 1!
                        These lessons are based off of the AP Computer Science A curriculum, but the content has been specifically designed and reworked for beginners.
                        There will be a multitude of interactive objects in this website such as exercises, quizzes, and videos.
                        These lessons will teach you very important concepts in Java and computer science in general.
                        We also have very useful "Codingbat-style" exercises for intermediate programmers and a challenging quiz for AP CS students.
                        If you're looking for those resources, check out the exercises and quiz links in the navigation menu, otherwise, continue on ahead!.

                    <h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you have experience in coding in block languages, you may be pretty familiar with the content within these lessons.
                        One thing you should keep in mind though is that Java requires a careful attention to detail.
                        If you mispell a keyword or forget a semicolon in your program, you're toast!
                        In order to write code, you're gonna need an Integrated Development Environment, also called IDEs for short.
                        They make coding a lot easier and you can pick the one you like best!
                        There's also a built-in IDE that you can open up in the bottom left corner of the website.

                        Learning to code can be tough, but it feels very rewarding when you finally figure it out!
                        Your brain also grows while you're figuring out how to solve problems and fix errors, so keep a growth mindset and stay positive.
                        And if you want some help while coding, try pair programming with a friend.
                        It's when two people work together on one computer.
                        One person types while the other gives ideas and feedback.
                        It's a great way to learn and write better code!

                    <h2>What Is Java?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Java is a <b>Programming Language</b>, a special kind of language that you can use to communicate with the computer.
                        You can use Java to create all sorts of applications such as Minecraft and Netflix.
                        There are different types of programming languages, such as Python or C++, and these programming languages each fall into their own categories.
                        Java is an <b>Object-Oriented Language</b>, meaning it is designed around objects rather than functions.
                        To put it simply, objects are things that store data while functions are things that receive and do stuff with data.
                        A vital aspect of Java and Object-Oriented Programming as a whole is the <b>Class</b>.
                        A <b>Class</b> is basically a blueprint for making objects.

                    <p>
                        In order for your program to actually do something, you're gonna need a <b>Main Method</b>.
                        A method is just a fancy term for a function within an object.
                        The <b>Main Method</b> is a special type of method that automatically runs when the program starts.
                        However, you will need to define what your main method will do, that is where <b>Statements</b> come in.
                        A <b>Statement</b> is just a line of code that does a specific action, such as calling another function.
                        You can write a <b>Print Statement</b> to print out anything you specify within its parameters.
                        The parameters are basically inputs that the method needs to perform an action.

                    <p>
                        You can input numbers in the print statement as arguments.
                        Arguments are the real pieces of data that your input into the method.
                        If you've noticed, you can't put in letters into your print statement, or else you'll get an error.
                        In order to fix this issue, you will need to create a <b>String Literal</b>.
                        <b>String Literals</b> are letters, words, or sentences surrounded by quotation marks so that Java will recognize them as such.
                        The program runs the what is in the main method and will output the results into the console.
                        The console is the place where the results of your code is outputted.

                    <p>
                        Remember any errors you've encountered as you've been coding?
                        They're called <b>Bugs</b>, and the specific type of bug you've encountered is called a <b>Syntax Error</b>.
                        The reason they occur is because the <b>Compiler</b> fails to understand and <b>Compile</b> your code.
                        The <b>Compiler</b> is basically a translator that turns your code into machine code that the computer can actually understand.
                        Machine code is just a bunch of 0s and 1s that is unreadable to people, but understood by computers.
                        The process of fixing these bugs is called <b>Debugging</b>.
                        Many professional programmers also write little pieces of code called <b>Comments</b>.
                        These are just notes left by programmers for themselves or other programmers and they are not read by the compiler.

                    <p>
                        Alright, let's talk about <b>Variables</b>!
                        <b>Variables</b> are pieces of code that you can use to store simple types of data.
                        The type of stuff you can store in a variable is dependent on its <b>Data Type</b>.
                        <b>Data Types</b> are just different types of data, such as numbers or words.
                        Variables can only hold data from one type only.
                        There are two main types of variables, <b>Primitive Variables</b> and <b>Reference Variables</b> (also known as objects!).
                        <b>Primitive Variables</b> are simple and can store numbers.
                        <b>Reference Variables</b> are much more complex and can store a wide variety of things such as other objects and functions.

                    <h2>What Are Data Types?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are three main types of primitive data types, <b>int</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>boolean</b>.
                        An <b>int</b> is a whole number that can be positive or negative.
                        A <b>double</b> is just like an integer, but they are decimal numbers instead of whole numbers.
                        A <b>boolean</b> is either a true or false value and are often used for if statements.
                        Remember <b>Strings</b>? Well, it turns out that they aren't primitive types, they're actually reference types (objects).
                        A <b>String</b>, as you've seen before, can store letters, numbers, and symbols.
                        You can <b>Concatenate</b> Strings, meaning you can combine two strings together, by using the "+" sign.

                    <h2>How Do I Create A Variable?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to create a variable, you must <b>Declare</b> it, meaning you must give it a type and a name.
                        When you declare a variable, the computer actually leaves aside a certain number of <b>Bits</b> within the computer's <b>Memory</b> to store data for your variable.
                        <b>Bits</b> are basically just 0s and 1s and are the simplest type of data a computer can store.
                        Technically, all data types are made up of bits, their complexity just depends on the number of bits used to create that data type.
                        The computer's <b>Memory</b> is an electronic device used to store data temporarily, not to be confused with storage.
                        You can name your variables anything you want, except for keywords such as "int" or "boolean".
                        Most professionals use a naming system for their variables, such as <b>Camel Case</b>, to keep them consistent.
                        If you want to make sure the value you give to your variable doesn't change, you can use the <b>final</b> keyword.

                    <p>
                        I hope you like math cause we're gonna use it in our code.
                        Remember variables? Well, to assign values to your variables, you will need the <b>Assignment Operator</b>!
                        An <b>Operator</b> is a symbol used in <b>Expressions</b> to perform actions in your code.
                        <b>Expressions</b> are statements that use operators.
                        The <b>Assignment Operator</b> (=) is a type of operator that is used to assign values to variables.
                        When you assign a value to a variable for the first time, it is called initialization.
                        You can also update variables by reassigning new values to them.
                        You can even use the value within variables to store them within other variables!

                    <h2>What Are Arithmetic Operators?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are also other types of operators such as the arithmetic operators.
                        These operators can add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers and doubles.
                        Use the +, -, *, / symbols to perform arithmetic expressions.
                        Expressions with more than one operator are called <b>Compound Expressions</b>.
                        There is a certain order when it comes to compound Expressions and this order is known as <b>Operator Precedence</b>.
                        Basically, they follow the standard conventions of arithmetic such as PEMDAS.
                        If you try to perform an impossible mathematical task, such as dividing by 0, the computer will produce an <b>Arithmetic Exception</b> after compiling.
                        If you perform arithmetic operations with values of the same data type, they will always evaluate to the same data type.
                        For example, ints will always return an int and doubles will always return a double.
                        However, if you combine ints and doubles in an expression, it will always return a double.

                    <p>
                        There's also another operator called the <b>Modulo Operator</b> and it looks like this: %.
                        Use this operator to get the remainder of a division.
                        For example, 5 % 2 is 1 because 2 goes into 5 two times with a remainder of 1.
                        There are some other operators that will be talked about later on.
                        You can use the <b>Equivalence Operator</b> (==) to compare to values.
                        If they are the same, it will return "true", otherwise, it returns false.
                        To negate an equivalence operator, you can use the <b>Negation Operator</b> (!=) to check if two things are NOT equal.

            <h1>What Are Compound Assignment Operators?</h1>
            <p>
                Are reassignment statements too much for you to type?  Well don't worry, cause <b>compound assignment operators</b> are here to help you!

These shortcuts can do a math operation and assignment in one step! 
For example, instead of writing x = x + 1 to add 1 to a number called x, you can write <b>x += 1</b>! And guess what? It works with other operators too like +, -, *, /, and %!

Now, let's talk about the coolest shortcut operators, <b>++</b> and <b>--</b>. The ++ adds 1 to a number and -- subtracts 1. You can't use them with other operators, but they're still pretty awesome! So, <b>x++</b> means the same as x += 1 and x = x + 1. And yep, you guessed it, the -- does the opposite!

These shortcuts are like magic spells that help you save time and make your code shorter! So go ahead and use them! And remember, on the exam you can use either <b>x++</b> or <b>++x</b> to add 1 to a value. The only difference is when you're assigning it to another variable. So go forth and conquer the coding world with your amazing new skills! The code below replicates the previous code, but with compound assignment operators instead.

<pre>
    <code class="language-java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int score = 3;
        score += 2;
        score %= 2;
        System.out.println(score); //Prints 1
    }
}

            <h1>How Do We Convert Data Types</h1>
            <p>
                Type casting in Java is like changing the "shape" of a variable. It's like when you take a ball of clay and shape it into a cool mug or bowl. Type casting lets you change a variable's type from one to another. So, you can turn a number into a temporary value in a different data type using <b>(int)</b> or <b>(double)</b>.

Now, when you divide two integers, Java assumes you want an integer result. But, if you use both integers and decimals, Java thinks you want a double result. And if you want to get a double result from a math operation with integers, you can use <b>casting</b>.

But wait, there's more! You can also round a double to the nearest integer using <b>(int)(x + 0.5)</b> or <b>(int)(x - 0.5)</b> for negative numbers. So, if you have a decimal number that's almost a whole number, you can use casting to round it to the nearest integer.

But remember, Java has a limit for how many digits it can store for any double number. That means calculations on computers might not always be accurate. And finally, int values in Java have a limited range from <b>Integer.MIN_VALUE</b> to <b>Integer.MAX_VALUE</b>. If an int value goes beyond that range, it could result in an incorrect value. So, it's important to keep track of your variables and make sure they don't go out of bounds!
            </p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int score = 3;
        System.out.println(score / 2); //Prints 1
        System.out.println((double)score / 2); //Prints 1.5
    }
}
