                <h2>Why Programming? Why Java?</h2>
                <p>
                    A Java program is like a set of instructions you give to a computer. It starts with the words 'public class NameOfClass { }'. If you're making your own program, each part should be in a separate file with a name that matches what's inside the curly braces.

Most Java programs start with 'public static void main(String[] args) { }'. This is where you put the code you want the computer to do.

To show things on the computer screen, you can use 'System.out.print()' or 'System.out.println()'. Just put what you want to show inside the parentheses. If you use 'System.out.println()', it will start a new line afterwards.

In Java, you can write text inside double quotes (" ").

Every time you write a command in Java, it needs to end with a semicolon (;). You can use { } to group things together, and // or /* */ to write notes that the computer will ignore.

When you're done with your Java program, a compiler will turn it into a file that the computer can run. If you make a mistake, the compiler will tell you what went wrong. Make sure to use semicolons and matching { }, (), and "" when you're writing your program
                </p>

                <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, a variable is like a container that can hold a value that can change over time. You can give this container a name so that you can remember what's inside it.

To make a variable, you need to pick what kind of value you want to put in it, like a whole number or a number with a decimal point. Then you give the variable a name, like "score" or "gpa". You can also give the variable a value right away, like saying "score is 8".

There are three types of values that we're using in this course: whole numbers, numbers with decimal points, and true or false statements.

Every variable has a space in the computer's memory where it stores its value. When you make a variable with a whole number or decimal point, the computer stores that number in that space.

When you make a variable "final", it means you can't change what's inside it after you've picked what goes in it.

                <h2>Expressions and Assignment Statements</h2>
                <p>
                    So, in Java, arithmetic expressions are like math problems that you can solve with numbers. You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of two numbers using special symbols like +, -, *, /, and %.

If you use only whole numbers in your math problem, then the answer will also be a whole number. But if you use a number with a decimal point, then the answer will have a decimal point too.

You can also use brackets to change the order in which the math problems are solved. And if you try to divide a number by zero, you'll get an error because it's not possible.

When you write a program, you can also use variables to store numbers, and the equals sign (=) to give them values. For example, you might write "x = 5 + 3" to give the variable "x" the value 8.

And when you run your program, it will solve these math problems and give you an answer. The answer will be a number too, and it might be a whole number or a decimal number, depending on the math problem you solved.

                <h2>Compound Assignment Operators</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, you can make some math problems easier to write by using special shortcuts. These shortcuts are called compound assignment operators, and they let you do an operation and store the result in a variable all in one step. For example, instead of writing "x = x + 5;", you can just write "x += 5;".

There are five of these shortcuts: "+=", "-=", "*=", "/=", and "%=". Each one does a different math operation (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, or finding the remainder), and then puts the answer back into the same variable.

There are also two other special symbols you can use to add or subtract 1 from a variable. These are called the increment operator "++" and the decrement operator "--". For example, if you had a variable called "count" with the value 5, you could write "count++" to make it 6, or "count--" to make it 4.

You can use these shortcuts with other math problems or assignments too. For example, you could write "count += 3;" to add 3 to the value of "count", or "total = price * quantity++;" to multiply the values of "price" and "quantity", and then add 1 to the value of "quantity" and store the result in "total".

But sometimes these shortcuts can be confusing, and they are not always used in the same way. So, we won't be learning about all the different ways they can be used right now.

                <h2>Casting and Ranges of Variables</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, type casting means changing the type of a variable to another type. This can be done using special operators like (int) or (double).

When you cast a double value to an int, it will lose the numbers after the decimal point. For example, if you cast 3.1415 to an int, the result will be 3.

Sometimes, in programming, int values can be changed to double values automatically.

If you want to round a double value to the nearest whole number, you can use (int)(x + 0.5) or (int)(x - 0.5) for negative numbers.

In Java, an integer is a type of value that uses a fixed amount of memory (4 bytes). This means that an int value must be within a certain range. If an expression gives an int value outside of this range, it is called an integer overflow and it can lead to an incorrect value within the allowed range.
