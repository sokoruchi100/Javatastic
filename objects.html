                <h1>Using Objects</h1>
            </section>
            <section id="sec1">
                <h2>Objects - Instances of Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, a class is like a plan for making something new. It tells you what things your new thing will have (like color, size, or shape) and what it can do (like move, make a sound, or show a picture).

An object is like something you make from the plan. It's a real, actual thing that has all the things and can do all the actions that the plan says it can. Each object is a little bit different, even though they all came from the same plan.

For example, imagine you have a plan for making a toy car. The plan tells you what color the car will be, what it's made of, how big it is, and how it can move. Once you make the car, you can see that it's red, made of plastic, small, and can drive around on wheels.

An attribute is like something that the toy car knows about itself. It might know its own color, its size, or how fast it can go. These are things you can change about the car if you want to.

A method is like something the toy car can do. For example, it might be able to drive forward or backward, turn left or right, or honk its horn. When you use a method, you tell the toy car what to do, and it does it.

So, a class is like a plan, an object is like a thing you make from the plan, an attribute is like something the thing knows about itself, and a method is like something the thing can do.

                <h2>Creating and Initializing Objects: Constructors</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, constructors are special methods that create a new object and give it its starting values. They have the same name as the class they belong to. Constructors are important because they make sure the object is created correctly.

The signature of a constructor is its name and a list of what values it needs to start the object. This tells Java how to create the object.

Overloading is when there is more than one constructor in a class. They have different ways of starting the object depending on what values you give them.

To create a new object, you use the word "new" followed by the name of the class. This creates a new object and calls the constructor.

A no-argument constructor is a constructor that doesn't need any values to start the object. It's useful for creating objects with default values.

Parameters let you give values to a constructor to start the object with. The parameter list tells Java what values to give to the constructor.

Actual parameters are the real values that you give to the constructor. Formal parameters are what the constructor calls them.

When you pass a value to a constructor or method, it only passes a copy of that value. This means that changes made to the parameter inside the constructor or method won't affect the original value outside of it.

                <h2>Calling Methods Without Parameters</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, methods are like sets of instructions that tell objects of a class how to behave. To use a method, you type the name of the object followed by a dot (.) and the name of the method.

A method signature includes the name of the method and the types and names of any values it needs to work.

Procedural abstraction means you can use a method without knowing exactly how it works. It's like driving a car without knowing how the brakes work.

When you call a method or constructor, the program stops what it's doing and runs the instructions in the method or constructor. After it finishes, the program goes back to what it was doing before.

If you forget to create an object before using a method, Java might get confused and stop working. This is called a NullPointerException.

Some methods work with objects of a class, while others don't need an object to work. We call the first type "object methods" and the second type "static methods."
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="sec4">
                <h2>Calling Methods With Parameters</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, a method is like a set of instructions that tell a program what to do with an object. Think of it like a recipe that tells you how to make a cake.

To use a method with an object, you need to use the object's name and the dot (.) symbol followed by the method's name. For example, if you have a dog object named "myDog" and a method named "play", you would use "myDog.play();" to make the dog object play.

Sometimes, methods need more information to work properly, and that's when we use "arguments." Arguments are like extra ingredients that we put into the recipe to make it work better. For example, if we had a method to feed the dog, we might need to tell it how much food to give, and we do that by passing an argument to the method. So, we might say "myDog.feed(2);" to feed the dog two units of food.

But we have to be careful when passing arguments, because they need to match the method's instructions exactly. The method instructions are called the "method signature" and they tell us what kind of arguments we need to pass and in what order. For example, if we have a method signature like "feed(int foodAmount)", that means we need to pass an integer argument for the food amount in order for the method to work properly.

                <h2>Calling Methods that Return Values</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, sometimes when you ask an object to do something, it will give you something back. It's like when you ask your friend for a toy, and they give it back to you when they're done playing with it. That thing that you get back from the object is called a "return value."

To use this return value, you have to catch it and save it in a box, which is called a "variable." The box you use to save it has to be the same type as the return value. It's like when your teacher gives you a piece of paper with a number on it, and you need to put it in your box with the same number on it.

You can also use the return value to do math. It's like if your teacher gave you a piece of paper with a number on it, and then you added 5 to it to get a bigger number.

But you have to be careful! If the object gives you back a number, you can't save it in a box that's supposed to hold a word. It's like if your friend gave you a toy and you tried to put it in your lunchbox - it just won't fit!
                </p>

                <h2>Strings</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, a string is a bunch of letters and numbers that can be saved as a special thing called an object. You can make a string object by typing it out like this: String s = "hi"; or by using a special code like this: String t = new String("bye"); If you don't write anything for the string, it will be "null" which means it's like a blank piece of paper.

You can put two strings together using the + or += sign, which makes a new string object. You can also add regular numbers and letters to a string object, and it will automatically turn them into a string object.

In Java, some special characters are called escape sequences, which are written with a \ in front of them. For example, if you want to write a sentence that has a " in it, you can use the escape sequence " to show that you don't want the computer to think that the sentence is over. There are other special escape sequences like \ for a backslash, and \n for a new line.

                <h2>String Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, strings are like words or sentences made up of letters. An index is like a number that tells you where a specific letter is in the string. The first letter in a string is at index 0.

The length of a string is just how many letters are in it. You can also make a new string from part of an existing string using the "substring" method, but you need to be careful not to use index values that are too high or too low, or you'll get an error.

Strings in Java are like a box that you can't change once you've made it, but you can make new boxes with similar letters inside. There are some useful things you can do with strings in Java, like finding out how many letters are in a string, or making a new string from part of an existing one.

                <h2>Wrapper Classes - Integer and Double</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, we have some basic data types like int and double. But sometimes we want to use them like objects to perform some actions. That's where the Integer and Double classes come in. These classes help us create objects from these basic data types.

The Integer class is used for whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, etc., and the Double class is used for numbers with decimals, like 1.5, 2.3, etc.

These classes have some special tools, called methods and constructors, that we can use to work with them. For example, we can create a new Integer object with a specific value using the Integer constructor, or we can find out the smallest or largest value that can be represented by an Integer.

There is a special feature in Java called autoboxing that automatically converts a basic data type to its corresponding object wrapper class. And there is also a feature called unboxing that does the opposite, converting an object to its corresponding basic data type.

These features can be really helpful for making our code easier to read and write, and for avoiding mistakes that can happen when working with basic data types and object wrapper classes.

                <h2>Using the Math Class</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, there is something called "Math" that can do some really cool things with numbers. We use it by writing "Math." and then the name of the thing we want it to do. For example, if we write "Math.abs(-5)", it will give us the number 5, because the "abs" method means "absolute value", which means the number without any negatives.

There are lots of other things we can do with Math too! We can use "Math.pow" to raise one number to the power of another number, or "Math.sqrt" to find the square root of a number. And if we want a random number, we can use "Math.random".

When we use "Math.random", it gives us a number between 0 and 1, but not including 1. We can use that number to get a random number in a range we choose. For example, if we want a random number between 5 and 10, we can use this formula:

(int)(Math.random()*6) + 5

The "6" is the range of numbers we want to choose from (because 10-5+1 = 6), and the "5" is the minimum number we want to start from. So if we run that code, it might give us 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, because those are all the numbers in that range.
