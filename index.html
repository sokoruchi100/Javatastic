        <section id="oop">
            <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can
                contain data and code. In this section, we'll explore how to use OOP concepts in Java.</p>

        <section id="collections">
            <h2>Java Collections</h2>
            <p>Java Collections provide a group of classes and interfaces that can be used to store and manipulate
                groups of objects. In this section, we'll cover the basics of Java Collections and show you how to use
                them in your Java programs.</p>

        <section id="io">
            <h2>Input/Output</h2>
            <p>Input/Output (I/O) is a critical aspect of Java programming, as it enables programs to interact with
                external devices and systems. In this section, we'll cover how to use Java's I/O classes to read and
                write data from files and other sources.</p>
