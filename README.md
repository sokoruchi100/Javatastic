# Javatastic

Javatastic is a website designed to teach kids who are interested in learning Java. It also prepares students for the AP Computer Science A Exam. I created this project to help spark off an interest in programming for kids. The project houses a 3-dimensional home page, an interactive multi-section lesson, a challenging exercise, and a 20 question quiz. The project also houses a serverless back-end function made with Java that compiles and runs Java code sent by users. I hope you enjoy this website. This website was designed by Daniel Ting for the Coded By Kids Ctrl + Shift Web Development Competition.
