            <h2>Welcome to <strong>Javatastic</strong>, my educational Java website!</h2>
            <p> Don't fret if you don't know anything about code because this website is designed for anyone. <em>But</em>, that doesn't mean this website won't be useful for people who already know how to code in Java. AP students can also use this website as review for the AP Computer Science A Exam in May. Check out the units down below to get a sense of what to expect. There are a total of 10 pages for each unit and each page contains intuitive information, interactive challenges, and a short quiz designed for AP students. Have fun!</p>

        <section id="fundamentals">
            <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>In this section, we'll cover the fundamentals of Java programming, including variables, data types,
                control structures, and more.</p>
            <a href="fundamentals.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="objects">
            <h2>Methods and Objects</h2>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can
                contain data and code. In this section, we'll explore how to use methods and fields of instantiated objects.</p>
            <a href="objects.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="conditionals">
            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>Conditionals can be used to add logic and conditions to your programs. In this section, we'll cover the basics of creating an if statement and show you how to use them in your Java programs.</p>
            <a href="conditional.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="loops">
            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <p>Loops are a critical aspect of Java programming, as they enable programs to repeatedly run a piece of code autonomously. In this section, we'll cover how to use while loops and for loops.</p>
            <a href="loops.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="classes">
            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p>Classes are a fundamentally crucial aspect of Java programming as it is the foundation of the OOP paradigm. In this section, we'll cover how to write a Java class and the key principles to follow.</p>
            <a href="classes.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="arrays">
            <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>Arrays are an important type of data that can store multiple pieces of information in a more orderly fashion. In this section, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of arrays and utilize them effectively.</p>
            <a href="arrays.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="arraylists">
            <h2>ArrayLists</h2>
            <p>ArrayLists are similar to arrays, but have unique properties that seek to fix the issues with regular arrays. In this section, we'll explore what ArrayLists are and how to create efficient sorting and searching algorithms.</p>
            <a href="arraylists.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="2darrays">
            <h2>2D Arrays</h2>
            <p>2D Arrays are another important data type, sort of like an array within an array. In this section, we'll explore what 2D Arrays can do and how we can use them.
            </p>
            <a href="2darrays.html" class="button">Start Learning</a>
        </section>
        <section id="inheritance">
            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>Inheritance is a crucial concept in OOP programming that uses classes to their maximum potential. In this section, we'll use inheritance in designing and instantiating our classes.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="recursion">
            <h2>Recursion</h2>
            <p>Recursion is a wacky, yet important concept involving a function calling itself. In this section, we'll explore how recursion works and how we can use it to create more efficient methods.
